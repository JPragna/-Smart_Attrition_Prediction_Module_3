File Descriptions
/data/: Contains the raw and cleaned dataset files.

/notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for each step in the project (EDA, Feature Selection, Model Training, etc.)

/outputs/: Contains output files such as performance tables, plots, and SHAP explanations.

Usage
Step 1: Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

01_EDA.ipynb: Perform exploratory data analysis.

02_feature_selection.ipynb: Feature selection and multicollinearity check.

03_model_training.ipynb: Train the models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

04_tuning.ipynb: Tune the hyperparameters and apply SMOTE.

05_interpretability.ipynb: Explain model predictions using SHAP and analyze feature importance.

06_final_report.ipynb: Generate the business insights report for key attrition drivers.

Step 2: Analyze results:

Check /outputs/ for performance comparison tables, plots, and reports.
