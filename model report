# üìä Business Insights Report ‚Äì Module 3: Attrition Prediction

## üß© Objective
Build a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving, and explain key drivers of attrition. The focus was on:
- High Precision (minimize false positives)
- Good Recall (catch actual attrition cases)
- Interpretability for HR decision-making

## üîç Key Findings

### Attrition Distribution
| Class | Description       | Count (Before SMOTE) | Count (After SMOTE) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 0     | Not Attrited      | 986                  | 986                 |
| 1     | Attrited (Left)   | 190                  | 986                 |

‚úÖ SMOTE successfully balanced the dataset to handle class imbalance.

## üìà Model Evaluation Summary

| Model              | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Best Parameters                          |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 72%      | 0.33      | 0.72   | 0.46     | `C=1`, `solver='saga'`                    |
| Random Forest       | 84%      | 0.49      | 0.45   | 0.47     | `n_estimators=200`, `max_depth=20`        |
| XGBoost             | 84%      | 0.50      | 0.43   | 0.46     | `learning_rate=0.1`, `max_depth=10`, `n_estimators=100` |

> üéØ **Conclusion:**  
Random Forest and XGBoost provided the best balanced performance. Logistic Regression had higher recall, useful for early detection.

## üìå Business Insights

### 1. **Years at Company**
- Risk spikes for new employees (<2 years) and long-tenured employees (>10 years).
- Suggests need for stronger onboarding and career progression mapping.

### 2. **Age**
- Younger employees more likely to leave, potentially due to lack of growth opportunities.
- Recommend targeted retention strategies for early-career employees.

### 3. **Monthly Income**
- Low income linked to higher attrition.
- Conduct salary benchmarking and offer retention bonuses.

### 4. **OverTime**
- Frequent overtime is a strong signal of dissatisfaction.
- Promote workload balancing and enforce work-hour policies.

### 5. **Satisfaction Index**
- Low engagement and satisfaction lead to exits.
- Deploy regular pulse surveys and act quickly on feedback.
